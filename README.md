# TTRSS-Reader
TTRSS-Reader (or ttrss-reader-fork) is a fork of the original Project from [ttrss-reader](https://code.google.com/p/ttrss-reader/). I took the sourcecode and continued the development because the original owner didn't reply to any messages back then (and has not done so as of today).

It is a client application for the RSS-Reader [Tiny Tiny RSS](http://tt-rss.org/), a PHP-based online feedreader which runs on your own webspace. It is accessible with any browser and even supports keyboard shortcuts through javascript.
Download

Since google announced that the downloads from google-code will not be available after January 14th, 2014 I started to move all downloads to google-drive. The commentary with the current changelog will be removed in the process but the full changelog can be viewed in the Wiki.

# Note regarding support and F-Droid
Since [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.ttrssreader) is often several months late with the build I have to make this clear: I won't provide support for versions which are not exactly or at least near to the version which is stated above on this site ("Current Version"). Please provide the full version information from the About-box within the app when reporting an issue!

# Changelog

# Contact
Please feel free to contact me via E-Mail (ttrss /at/ nilsbraden.de) or via the Bugtracker (Issues). If you have questions specifically about Tiny Tiny RSS you may ask me or visit the [Tiny-Tiny-RSS-Forum](http://tt-rss.org/forum/) or #tt-rss at irc.tt-rss.org. If I don't answer fast enough or am not willing to implement your suggestion please keep in mind that this is only a hobby for me and I'm unwilling to implement every little feature just beacuse you suggested I do so. You may implement it and send me pull-requests so I can include the features but I can't guarantee I will do this for every thing you want to have.
